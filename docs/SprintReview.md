## Sprint 1 - procure components and licensing
Done:
- Acquired STM32 Nucleo-H743Z12
- Went into Sprint 2 stuff
- familiarised STM32CubeIDE, FreeRTOS, ZephyrOS
- Downloaded Azure RTOS
- taught multithreading (sort of)

Not done:
- acquire ubuntu real-time
- acquire raspberry pi / Jetson Orin Nano

Successes:
- Improved understanding of RTOS development
- Able to deploy to microcontrollers for practical testing

What could be improved:
- RTOSes need niche packages to install which have scattered and incomplete documentation to understand the process. Potentially, could set up a dockerfile to overcome this.
- Need to produce onboarding training material for new members and make it easily available

## Sprint 2 - Upskilling and familiarising with processes in different OS and experiments
